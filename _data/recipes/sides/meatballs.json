		"For apple glaze, in bowl combine juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, cornstarch, ginger, and cayenne. In the same skillet over medium heat, cook and stir sauce until thickened and bubbly (should be at a full boil). Cook and stir 2 minutes more. Return meatballs to skillet to glaze and heat through. Transfer to serving dish. Top with green onions. Makes 12(4-meatball) appetizer servings."
