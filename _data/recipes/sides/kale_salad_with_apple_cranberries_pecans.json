	"steps":[
		"Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread pecans on baking tray. Toast until lightly golden and fragrant, about 5 to 10 minutes, tossing once or twice so they bake evenly. Remove tray from oven and set aside to cool.",
		"Pull kale leaves off the tough stems and discard stems. Use chef’s knife to chop kale into small, bite-sized pieces. Transfer kale to big salad bowl. Sprinkle small pinch of sea salt over kale and massage leaves with hands by lightly scrunching big handfuls at a time, until leaves are darker in color and fragrant.",
		"Thinly slice radishes (easier to do if you first chop off root end so you can place base of radish flat against cutting board).  Add to bowl.",
		"Coarsely chop pecans and cherries and add to bowl. Chop apple into small, bite-sized pieces and add to bowl as well. Crumble goat cheese over top.",
		"In small bowl, whisk dressing ingredients together and pour dressing over salad. Toss until salad is evenly coated with dressing. Serve immediately, or for even better flavor, let salad marinate in dressing for 10 to 20 minutes beforehand."
